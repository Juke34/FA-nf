# Wrapper for running the pipeline in MySQL mode - Use with nohup and ideally save log

# Parsing params.config (the same place as nexflow for sake of simplicity)

# If MySQL mode

# Check all MySQL params are there

# If so

# Run MySQL qsub process

# Run Nextflow pipeline

# Else, stop process

# Else, SQLite mode

# Run Nextflow pipeline
