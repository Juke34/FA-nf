* Check any potential problem with case in MySQL and SQLite
* In reports, put select distincts again tables
* Think about ID InterproScan
* Check better way to put source from ontology_terms ( blast_annotator IPSCN )
* Allow different GFF parsing (e. g., from transcriptome projects)
* Check why CDSearch why starts later
* Allow reports from KEGG orthologs (number of potential orthologs from KEGG species)
* Create definition table
* blast_hit reconsider
* Ensure KEGG version is respected and followed
* Fix ko_definition = to ko_definition=
* How to handle ';' in GFF descriptions
* Add ";" in definition of protein table. ex: "blast_def:PREDICTED: potassium voltage-gated channelKEGG:potassium voltage-gated channel Shaw-related subfamily C member 1;KEGG:potassium voltage-gated channel Shaw-related subfamily C member 1;". Avoid duplication as well
