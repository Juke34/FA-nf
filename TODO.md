* Check any potential problem with case in MySQL and SQLite
* In reports, put select distincts again tables
* Think about ID InterproScan
* Allow different GFF parsing (e. g., from transcriptome projects)
* Check why CDSearch why starts later
* Allow reports from KEGG orthologs (number of potential orthologs from KEGG species)
* blast_hit reconsider
* Ensure KEGG version is respected and followed
* Ensure debugging is working OK
* How to handle ';' in GFF descriptions
* Show source in go_term listing
* Put BLAST evalue as parameter
* Add PANNZER in analysis
* Venn Diagram of results
* Allow more flexibility for input parameters batch
* Consider other programs for BLAST process or similar: e.g. [GHOSTZ](http://www.bi.cs.titech.ac.jp/ghostz/) and [Argot2.5](http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/Argot2-5/)
