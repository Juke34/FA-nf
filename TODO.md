* Include an example dataset
    * Include some testing and CI
* Add PANNZER in analysis
* Add PhylomeDB in analysis
* Visualization of results
    * Venn Diagrams

* In reports, put select distincts again tables
* Check why CDSearch why starts later
* Allow reports from KEGG orthologs (number of potential orthologs from KEGG species)
* blast_hit reconsider
* Allow more flexibility for input parameters batch
* Consider other programs for BLAST process or similar annotation processes: e.g. [GHOSTZ](http://www.bi.cs.titech.ac.jp/ghostz/) and [Argot2.5](http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/Argot2-5/)
* Optimize KEGG API process
* Add option to detect if possible contamination from BLAST (inspiration from MEGAN)
* Allow more customization of chunks for programs. Fallback one and program specific
